# Heart Failure Detection with Machine Learning
**Overview**

This project aims to predict the risk of heart failure using machine learning techniques. It includes a robust Random Forest Classifier model trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical records to classify individuals into high or low-risk categories. Additionally, it features both a web application and an Android app for easy access and user interaction.

**Features**

1. Random Forest Classifier: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to provide accurate predictions based on patient data.
2. Web Application: Built with HTML, CSS, and Flask, allowing users to input their data and receive instant predictions through a web browser.
3. Android App: Developed using Kivy and Buildozer, extending the reach of the model to mobile users for convenient access on Android smartphones.
